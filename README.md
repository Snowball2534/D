1.  Contact Management System /contactsLinkedList.cpp/  
    The system implements the linked list structure to achieve the functions of inserting, querying, deleting, updating, and outputting.
    Querying is the basic operation for other operations, and key is unique in the system to accommodate the querying operation.
2.  Josephus Problem /JosephusProblem/  
    Implement Josephus Problem using two storage methods: 1) sequential storage structure 2) linked storage structure
3.  Priority Queue /priorityQueue.cpp/  
    Implement priority queue using binary heap by sequential storage structure.
    To accommodate the calling of the function in the future applications, the interface should be as general as possible.
4.
